# ICS-anon

ICS-anon is a proxy server, that re-serves an ICS calendar but anonymizes the detailed contents.

It is designed to be used to make it possible to publicize a private calendar without leaking more information than strictly required.

It can for instance be used to sync a Nextcloud Calendar to a Google Calendar as “busy” slots without leaking more information than strictly required.
